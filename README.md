## Inspiration and Challenges

Our inspiration came from recognizing the need for a user-friendly solution in the tender management space. We envisioned a platform that not only streamlines the tender application process but also serves as a hub for businesses and entrepreneurs to connect and thrive.

**Technical Challenge:**
The primary technical challenge was creating a robust platform that integrates seamlessly with various databases, ensuring real-time updates on the latest tenders. Achieving an intuitive user interface while handling a large dataset posed challenges that demanded innovative solutions.

## Learnings and Future Iterations

**Technical Learnings:**
The project provided valuable insights into database optimization, front-end development, and collaborative coding practices. We delved into technologies that enhance real-time data processing and user interactions.
## File Descriptions
[freeconsole.py](console.py) - the console contains the entry point of the command interpreter. 
List of commands this console current supports:
* `EOF` - exits console 
* `quit` - exits console
* `<emptyline>` - overwrites default emptyline method and does nothing
* `create` - Creates a new instance of`BaseModel`, saves it (to mysql database) and prints the id
* `destroy` - Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the database). 
* `show` - Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id.
* `all` - Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. 
* `update` - Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the mysql database). 

#### `models/` directory contains classes used for this project:
[base_model.py](/models/base_model.py) - The BaseModel class from which future classes will be derived
* `def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` - Initialization of the base model
* `def __str__(self)` - String representation of the BaseModel class
* `def save(self)` - Updates the attribute `updated_at` with the current datetime
* `def to_dict(self)` - returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of the instance

Classes inherited from Base Model:
* [category.py](/models/category.py)
* [biddoc.py](/models/biddoc.py)
* [language.py](/models/language.py)
* [region.py](/models/region.py)
* [tender.py](/models/tender.py)
* [utype.py](/models/utype.py)
* [user.py](/models/user.py)

#### `/models/engine` directory contains DB Storage class that handles Databse connections :
[db_storage.py](/models/engine/db_storage.py) - connect to database using sqlalchemy
* `def all(self)` - returns the dictionary __objects
* `def new(self, obj)` - sets in __objects the obj with key <obj class name>.id
* `def save(self)` - serializes __objects to the database 
* `def reload(self)` -  deserializes the JSON file to __objects
* `def count(self)` - count each models and their row size

#### `api/v1/ ` Api integration 
[app.py](/api/v1/app.py) - creates API instance
* route('/status) - inform the status of api using index.py file
* route('/biddocs) - retrives form biddocs table and Has GET/POST/PUT/DELETE functions
* route('/category) - retrives form categories table and Has GET/POST/PUT/DELETE functions
* route('/language) - retrives form languages table and Has GET/POST/PUT/DELETE functions
* route('/regions) - retrives form regions table and Has GET/POST/PUT/DELETE functions
* route('/tenders) - retrives form tenders table and Has GET/POST/PUT/DELETE functions
* route('/users) - retrives form users table and Has GET/POST/PUT/DELETE functions
* route('/tender_categories) - Link a Category object to a Tender

#### `static/assets/js/` Jquary functions
* freejs-load.js  - a jquary for loading leftside nav bars menu items(language,region & categories)
* freejs-search.js - a jquary for searching database using API POST method and retrive data and replace main section area in html

**Next Iteration:**
In the future, we envision incorporating machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences. Enhancements in data security and scalability will be a focus, ensuring the platform can handle increased user engagement.
